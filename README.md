# Diagnostic Cognitive Model feature of IBM-Watson Classroom.

</p> 

## Executive Summary/Abstract.

From 2014 - 2019, IBM attempted to expand its education-technology presence.  It launched a cloud-based platfrom called *Watson Classroom*. Personalization of instruction for each individual student was its vision.  

Mainstream education uses an operating model that resembles an assembly line [[F. J. Bramante, R. L. Colby]](https://amzn.to/2x5ydJ9).  What each student knows is presumed to be determined largely by the amount of time spent sitting in the classroom.  What and how quickly students learn actually varies due to a wide variety of factors.

*Watson Classroom* attempted to catch a the *Personalized-Learning* or *Competency-Based Education* wave of education reform [[U.S. Dept of Education]](https://www.ed.gov/oii-news/competency-based-learning-or-personalized-learning). Instead of measuring the amount of time spent in the classroom, this new method focuses on *evidence of learning*. Instruction and other learning activities are designed not just to transmit information.  They also elicit *evidence* that knowledge has actually been gained ([[C. A. Tomlinson, 2014]](http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108029.aspx), [[G. Wiggins, J. McTighe, 2005]](http://www.ascd.org/Publications/Books/Overview/Understanding-by-Design-Expanded-2nd-Edition.aspx)).  Assembling the body of each student's evidence of learning leads to a complete, granular view of her strengths and weaknesses. *Watson Classroom* sought to assemble this perspective.

This holistic, granular view of each student's *state of knowledge* — marketed as *Mastery* — was one of three key features contained in *Watson Classroom.*  The product also contained a high-level view of each student's academic status.  It was an attempt at reformulating a [*Student Information System*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_information_system), a student-data system most educational systems use.  It also contained a content-recommendation solution.  This used [natural-language processing](https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32) to identify supplementary materials to reinforce individual students' weaknesses, identified by *Mastery*.

|ClientAdoption|Descriptions of offerings and materials to help client school districts adopt and derive value from *Watson Classroom*. As with most technologies, deriving maximum value depends on employment of certain business practices. These methods and consulting offerings helped clients get those in place.|
|ConceptOfOperations|Graphical and other materials illustrating the concept of operations underlying the *Mastery* feature.  It was based on fusing concepts from well-established practices in the educational literature.  These artifcats elaborate.| 
|CurriculumAlignmentAnalsisReporting|This contains artifacts — fusion of python and SQL technologies — used to analyze the degree of alignment of clients' curricula.  The *Mastery* feature required a well-aligned, digitized curriculum to function.|
